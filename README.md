# Mosquito Midgut Microbiota Analysis

This project analyzes the bacterial communities in the midguts of *Culex quinquefasciatus* mosquitoes following different blood meal types. The analysis includes visualizations of bacterial abundance changes and species distribution across various conditions.

## Project Overview

- **Figure 1**: Stacked bar plot showing the relative abundance of bacterial species across individual mosquito midgut samples, grouped by blood meal type and controls.
- **Figure 2**: Heatmap illustrating log2 fold changes in bacterial abundance, highlighting species-specific responses to different blood meals.
- **Figure 3**: Heatmap showing the percentage distribution of bacterial species, emphasizing the impact of blood source on microbiota composition.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name



##Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

##Prepare Data:
Place your abundance_table_species1.tsv file in the project directory.

##Usage
Run the analysis script to generate the visualizations:

python analysis_script.py


##Data
Input: abundance_table_species1.tsv - Contains abundance data for bacterial species in mosquito midguts.
Output: Visualizations showing species abundance and distribution.
